1. This code is currently NOT fully functional. I'm getting an error "Something went wrong:could not prepare statement (1 no such table: items)". I'm hoping someone can review my code and tell me what is wrong? :-).
2. The CSS styling is no longer working i'm guessing this is due to Onsen's recent update to 2.x?
